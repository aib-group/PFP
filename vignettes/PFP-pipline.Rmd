## Introduction

Recent network fingerprint method based on GO knowledge and propagation clustering mentioned provide a novel representation of network differentiation known as biological spectra, or Network Fingerprint. This method was used to describe the relationship between multiple disease networks and its related pathways, and to visually compare and parse different diseases by generating a fingerprint overlay. To give a quantitative comparison of the mixed disease network, we achieve the function of complex network comparison based on pathway on the open scientific computing platform **R**, and present *PFP* package for fingerprint-based pathway analyzing and comparison of systems. Driven by the research needs of customers, *PFP* provides a unified interface to three similarity clustering algorithms. In addition, *PFP* can also provide multiscale statistical analysis and visualization, access to the specific attributes of different disease fingerprint.

This manual is a brief introduction to structure, functions and usage of *PFP* package. The PFP package provides a set of functions to support knowledge-based network fingerprint (PFP) framework. A biomedical network is characterized as a spectrum-like vector called “network fingerprint”, which contains similarities to basic reference networks. This framework provides a more intuitive way to decipher molecular networks, especially for large-scale network comparisons and clustering analyses.

The three main features of *PFP*:

- Basic reference networks generation.
- Network comparison, which encompasses network merging, annotation and
similarity scoring.
- \item Network standardization.

### Installation

*PFP* requires these packages: *magrittr*, *igraph*, *plyr*, *ggplot2*, *apcluster*, *dplyr*, *stringr*, *graph* and *KEGGgraph*. To install *PFP*, please note especially two depencies of *PFP*, *graph* and *KEGGgraph* are only available from [Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org). Appanrantly, function `install.packages()`can not insall Biocondutor packages. There is a `biocLite()`, a wrapper around `install.packages()` provided by Bioconductor, can be used to install both CRAN and Bioconductor packages simply. More details on `biocLite()` is available from [https://www.bioconductor.org/install/](https://www.bioconductor.org/install/). Thus, users can install PFP install the latest released version using `biocLite()` directly:

```{r install-pkg, eval=FALSE}
## install release version of PFP
source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite("PFP")
```

or install the  Bioconductor dependencies package first:

```{r nstall-pkg2, eval=FALSE}
## install release version of PFP
source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite(c("graph","KEGGgraph"))
install.packages("PFP")
```

It also allows users to install the latest development version from github, which requires  *devtools* package has been installed on your system or can be installed using `install.packages("devtools")`. Note that devtools sometimes needs some extra non-R software on your system -- more specifically, an Rtools download for Windows or Xcode for OS X. There's more information about devtools [here](https://github.com/hadley/devtools).

```{r install-pkg-github, eval=FALSE}
## install PFP from github, require biocondutor dependencies package pre-installed 
if (!require(devtools))
  install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("yiluheihei/PFP")
```

After installation, the \*{PFP} is ready to load into the current workspace by the following codes to the current workspace by typing or pasting the following codes:

```{r load-pkg,eval=TRUE, include=FALSE}
library(PFP)
```


Moreover, gene similarity data used in our *PFP* package is stored in a external data repository *PFPdata* [https://github.com/yiluheihei/datarepo](https://github.com/yiluheihei/datarepo) for the large size (about 16 MB). More details on how to construct External Data Repositories using the `Additional_repositories` field see The Coatless Professor [blog post](http://thecoatlessprofessor.com/programming/r-data-packages-in-external-data-repositories-using-the-additional_repositories-field/). Thus, users must install the *PFPdata* before the networkfinger print analyis as following code.

```{r eval=FALSE}
if (!require("PFPdata")) {
    install_data_package()
}
```
## Analysis Pipeline: from Basic Reference Network Generation to Network
Networkfingerprint Visualization

We will demonstrate go through an analysis pipeline to illustrate some of the main functions in *PFP*. This pipeline consists of several steps:

1. Basic Reference Network Generation: prepare the well-known biomedical netowks as the PFP framework reference networks. Several pathway databases have been developed for biological network research, e.g. KEGG, Reactome - ([https://reactome.org](https://reactome.org)). All of this pathway databases is well-stuied and can be used as the basic reference networks of PFP.
1. Network fingerprint calculation: The similarity between two biomedical networks is calculated based on the following intition: grouping the nodes in the merged network into strongly inter-connected communities with high functional similarity score between intra-community nodes in different networks The functional similarity was measured based on GO [@ashburner2000gene]. And we employed affinity propagation (AP) [@frey2007clustering] clustering algorithm to detect the aligned functional modules between the two networks to be compared.
1. Network fingerprint Visualization: Show the network fingerprint along all the reference networks. We could observe the differences among biological networks fingerprint intuitively from visualization.

### Generating well-studied basic reference networks

The basic idea of calculating the network fingerprint is to have the biomedical networks map to well-studied basic networks. KEGG PATHWAY is a collection of manually drawn pathway maps representing our knowledge on the molecular interaction and reaction networks. Since its first introduction in 1995, KEGG PATHWAY has been widely used as a reference knowledge base for understanding biological pathways and functions of cellular processes. The knowledge from KEGG has proven of great value by numerous work in a wide range of fields [@kanehisa2007kegg]. So by default, we take KEGG pathways as basic reference networks in *PFP* by default.

Function `load_KEGG_refnet()` can be used to retrieve the KEGG pathway maps with KEGG API [http://www.kegg.jp/kegg/rest/keggapi.html](http://www.kegg.jp/kegg/rest/keggapi.html). In KEGG pathways, only the pathways of the map are manual drawing, and to different organisms, the map reference helps the automatic generation of organism-specific pathway for each organism. The `organism` (e.g. `organsim ="hsa"`) parameter indicate the organism name of KEGG pathway maps.

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
## donot run, retrive pathway maps from KEGG database may take several minutes,
## we have pre-stored this data in our package
## PFPRefnet <- load_KEGG_refnet(organism = 'mmu')
data(PFPRefnet)
PFPRefnet <- new(Class = "PFPRefnet",network = network(PFPRefnet),
                 net_info = net_info(PFPRefnet))
# show the kegg reference networks
show(PFPRefnet)
```

We defined a new S4 class `PFPrefnet` to store the *PFP* reference networks. *PFP* also provides five kinds of methods for this S4 class:

1. `net()`: Exact the basic reference networks of `PFPRefnet`.
1. `group()`: Obtain the group information, group names, number and the
size of each group,e.g. KEGG pathway database contains seven group pathway maps.
1. `subnet()`: Extract or replace parts of the *PFP* basic reference
networks.
1. `show()`: Display of `PFPRefnet`.
1. `name()`: Extract the names of reference networks.

```{r keggrefnet-methods,echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE}
## group information of kegg reference networks
refnet_group <- group(PFPRefnet)
show(refnet_group)

## select goup 1 and 2, and subset this two groups
selected_group <- refnet_group$name[c(1,2)]
PFPnet <- subnet(PFPRefnet,selected_group)
show(PFPnet)
```

Detailed instructions for this five methods refer to package function help.

Obviously users can also customize a PFPRefnet as a reference for computing network fingerprint. Users can refer to the documents of `PFPRefnet`  about the composition details of this class. *graphite* [@sales2012g] allow users to build `graphNEL` object from several pathway databases.

```{r reactome-map}
## Reactome human pathway maps

## just choose first two pathway maps for testing

```

Then users can create their own customized \Rclass{PFPRefnet} object as following:

```{r customize-refnet,echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
## here, just take the above two reactome pathway maps as PFP basic reference
## networks as example

## only one group and two reference networks


## methods of PFPRefnet

```

### Network fingerprint calculation

PFP algorithm consists of three steps: merging network, nodes clustering and similarity scoring.

Network merging. The two networks to be compared are first merged into one. Given two networks *G1* and *G2*, the merged network *Gm* is constructed by connecting each node between the *G1* and *G2* network. Two nodes corresponding to the same protein in the merged network are replaced by a single node that inherited all the interactions from the two individual nodes in the subsequent process.

Clustering in merged network. Grouping the nodes in the merged network into strongly inter-connected communities with high functional similarity score between intra-community nodes in different networks. We employed affinity propagation (AP) clustering algorithm to detect the aligned functional modules between the two networks to be compared. The nodes are grouped on the cluster based on nearest neighbor analysis.

Similarity scoring. The calculation of similarity score is processed in two steps: First, local similarity for each cluster and network similarity among cluster. Second, standardization: the original similarity score depends on the topological properties of query network to some extent. There is implicit bias of network fingerprint, because the outliers could be greatly distorted the relevant pattern presented in the network fingerprint. In order to eliminate the possible topological weight differences, the similarity calculation process of each node are standardized processing and the final network fingerprint facing to users is totally standardized. The standardization process is based on the random distribution of similarity scores. To the number of nodes, the number of edges and node degree, these three topological properties of random network for standardized estimate are consistent with the original network.

To not affect the results of standardization and improve the efficiency of fingerprint calculation, we set limit on the permutation time (the default is 100) of background network randomization in the standardization process. Users can also adjust randomization time of background network according to their own demands for the precision of network fingerprint.

*PFP* provides the `calc_sim_score()` function for calculating the similarity score between two networks. As the similarity score is subjected to the size of the network, we use the maslov’s method [@maslov2002specificity] to randomize a network while preserving the degree distribution. The `nperm` parameter is added to `calc_sim_score()` refers to the permutation times (the default is 100) of random network while calculating the similarity score mentioned above. We define a S4 class `PFP` in our package to store the calculation results of network fingerprints.

Simply, we choose the two pathway maps `g` as a query network, and a subset networks of `kegg_refnet` as the reference networks. Then the PFP
can be calculated as following:

```{r sub0, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
## set g as the query network

## a subset of kegg_refnet, select the head five networks of group 1, 2

sub0 <- sub_PFP(object = PFP_test,group_name = 
                  unique(ref_net_info(PFP_test)$group)[c(2,4)],
                index = list(1:5,1:5))
## methods of PFP class
refnet_names(sub0)
head(sub0)
```

```{r sub1, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
sub1 <- sub_PFP(object = PFP_test,group_name = 
                  unique(ref_net_info(PFP_test)$group)[c(2,4)],
                index = list(c("mmu01230","mmu01521"),c("mmu04152")),
                index_type = "pathway_id")
## methods of PFP class
refnet_names(sub1)
head(sub1)
```

```{r sub2, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
sub2 <- sub_PFP(object = PFP_test,group_name = 
                  unique(ref_net_info(PFP_test)$group)[c(2,4)],
                index = list(c("MAPK signaling pathway",
                               "Phosphatidylinositol signaling system"),
                             c("Staphylococcus aureus infection",
                               "Leishmaniasis")),index_type = "pathway_name")
## methods of PFP class
refnet_names(sub2)
head(sub2)
```

### Network fingerprint visualization

*PFP* provides the `plot_PFP()` function to visualize the network fingerprint of a single query network.

```{r plot-PFP,echo=TRUE,eval=FALSE,fig.cap='Plot a PFP object',dev='pdf',fig.show='hold',out.width='.8\\linewidth', out.height='.7\\linewidth'}
plot_PFP(sub0)
