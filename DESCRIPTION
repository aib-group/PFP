Description: An implementation of the pathway fingerprint framework that introduced in paper "Pathway Fingerprint: a novel pathway knowledge and topology based method for biomarker discovery and characterization".  This method provides a systematic comparisons between a gene set (such as a list of differentially expressed genes) and well-studied "basic pathway networks" (KEGG pathways), measuring the importance of pathways and genes for the gene set, which is helpful for researchers to find the biomarkers and its function.
